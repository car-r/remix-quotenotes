# 5 Tips to remember what you read
{meta.pubDate}

Are you constantly reading the same paragraph trying to remember what you just read? You're not alone!
Most people will read the same paragraph more than once if they're trying to remember something important.
This article will break down 5 tips you can use to start remembering what you read.

## Take notes as you read.

It's no secret that taking notes helps you remember what you read. 
In fact, research has shown that taking notes while reading actually improves your memory of the material. 

But why is it so important to take notes? 

There are a few reasons why taking notes can help improve your memory: 

1. Taking notes forces you to focus on the material. 
2. Notes provide a "map" of the book, which makes it easier to recall information later on. 
3. Notes help you connect new information with information you already know.  
4. Notes allow you to review the material more than once.  
5. Taking notes is a great way to reduce stress and anxiety while reading.

One of the main benefits of taking notes while you read is that it forces you to focus on the material. 
When you're taking notes, you can't help but pay attention to what's being said because you want to make sure you write down everything accurately. 
This focused attention helps you remember the information better.

Good notes are the key to connecting the new information you're taking in with information that you already know.
Chances are if you're learning a new subject or reading something you're interested in, you have some knowledge about the subject.
New ideas will spark your interest, and you can jot down a note about it and how it improves your understanding on the topic.

Nobody wants to have to read a book more than once, unless of course it's a great book and you're reading it for fun!
Sometimes reading is required for school and for work, and you're just trying to get through the material
quickly and retain as much of the information as possible. Either way, taking good notes will
allow you to review the material more than once without reading the book cover to cover again.
Note taking can also help reduce any stress you may have while reading. Reading isn't always fun, even if you're
reading something you actually want to read. 

## Quote your favorite passages and share them on social media.

When you share book quotes on social media, you're not only sharing the thoughts of the author, but your own as well. 
By writing a brief explanation of why the quote resonated with you, you're providing your friends and followers with a little bit of insight into your thought process.
This can help spark discussion and encourage people to read the books that interest you.

Sharing book quotes on social media is also a great way to connect with others who share similar interests.
Reading a real estate book about short term rentals and what to share a post about it? Great! Someone is active in
the short term rental space may see that quote and comment their own thoughts and experiences about it providing even more insight!

You're also helping others get a better idea of what books are worth reading and add them to their "to-read" list.
Plus, discussing books with others can help remind you of scenes or passages from the book that you may have forgotten or missed entirely.

Quotes are powerful because they can sum up an entire book in just a few words. 
When you share book quotes on social media, you're giving your friends and followers a snapshot of the book that intrigued you enough to write it down. 
Quotes also make great conversation starters, so don't be afraid to start talking about the books you're reading with your friends and family!

## Create a summary and write down your thoughts on each book as you finish it. 

When you write a book summary, you're essentially creating a condensed version of the book. 
By writing a summary, you're forced to focus on the most important details and ideas from the book. 
This helps you remember the book better because you're not trying to remember everything â€“ just the most important points.

In addition, writing a book summary can also help you connect new information with information you already know.
By summarizing a book, you're creating a map of the book's contents. 
This "map" can help you recall information from the book more easily later on.

Finally, writing a book summary allows you to review the material more than once. 
By going over your summary, you'll be able to remember more details about the book and see how the different ideas relate to each other.

## Talk about the books you're reading with people with similar interests.

Having a conversation about things that you've read is a great way to solidify the ideas
of what you've just read into your mind. It also gives you a chance to hear what someone else thinks
about a particular topic from their point of view. This can help provide a more well rounded view
of the topic and understand it from all angles.

This tip links back to the second tip on sharing your favorite quotes on social media.
You may find that discussing books that your reading is best done online. People with similar interests
can gather on web forums, social media, or in the comments section of a YouTube video.
This is a great way to learn from those who may know more than you on whatever it is that you're reading.

## Re-read your favorite passages and take new notes to help cement them in your memory.

Altough nobody likes to re-read the same thing over and over again. Re-reading your favorite passages
is an effective technique for remembering what you read. Sometimes a new idea takes time to be digested.
Re-reading something that resonates with you or makes the lightbulb in your mind go off helps ensure
you're actually grasping what the passage is about.

Re-reading will lead to a better understanding, which ultimately leads to retaining the information.
Combining this tip with great notes creates the perfect environment for cementing this information into your memory.

## Conclusion

In a world where it seems like the answer to everything is literally in the palm of your hands,
being able to recall information may seem like a waste of time. For some things, that is probably true.
Topics that require a broad understanding to make sense of it allow you to make better decisions. And you
can't make better decisions if you can't retain information!

Hopefully these tips will allow you to remember what you read and have a positive impact on your future!
