twitter threads make you consolidate your takeaways into the most import points and attract
new followers! This blog post will teach you how to use QuoteNotes to tweet fire book reviews ðŸ”¥!


## Opening Tweet

Just like traditional marketing, the first tweet needs to hook the reader into reading the entire thread.
Start by including the title of the book and the author and a short, meaningful sentence about
how the book influenced you or changed your mind about something. You could also include
a single sentence summary of what the book is about.

## Use Quotes to Stay Organized.

QuoteNotes was designed to use meaningful quotes from a book as the spark to drive your
own thoughts about what you're reading. The app is most useful as a digital replacement to
highlighting in the book and taking notes in the margins. Once you've entered your favorite quotes
and the notes related to them, its time to pick out the best ones for your twitter thread.

You can favorite the quotes you want to include in your thread and use that as your starting point.
After taking a quick scan of your favorite quotes, you might start to see a themes or trends
that you'd like to highlight in your thread. If you haven't already, you can begin to tag each quote
to categorize them.

## Tag your Quotes

As mentioned above, the tag feature allows you to group your quotes by category. Say you're
reading a real estate investing book, you might want to add a few tags to stay organized.
Any quotes about short term rentals could have the tag "STR", while quotes relating to handling
tennants could be "property mgmt".

Lumping your quotes into different categories will help you determine which quotes to use for your
twitter thread. Pick four or five of your most used tags and then figure out the proper order for the thread.
Here is an example using a real estate investing book.

1. Investment Criteria
2. Short Term rentals
3. Property Management

## Use Your Notes!

Since you took such great notes while reading your book, you can finally put them to good use!
If there are particular quotes that you took a lot of notes on, chances are that quote
should be included in your twitter thread.

Its also a good idea to include a personal thought about each or most of the quotes in your review.
If there is enough room to include both the quote and your thought in a single tweet, do that. If not,
include your personal thoughts in the tweet immediately after the quote it is related to.

## Conclusion

Writing book reviews as a spring board for your own thoughts is not only a great way
to remember what you read, but also to build an audience. QuoteNotes helps you stay
organized while you read and actually retain the information that you're reading.
